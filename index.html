1. The data we collect and how it's used

  • IP Address and Browser information
  Used for analytics and to safely connect your accounts using OAuth
  • Discord ID, Twitch ID, YouTube Channels ID
    Collected when you login(connect) such services, used to give you roles on discord

2. Data shared
Your connected accounts data is not shared with third parties. We do use Cloudflare's Proxy and they collect some data and this page is hosted on GitHub Pages and they also collect data.
The privacy policy for third party services is linked at the bottom of the page.

3. Data removal
You may request for your data to be deleted at anytime.
If you have been banned your data will be anonymized (meaning your ids will go to a different table in the database where it cannot be correlated to your other services).
You may request data removal through email (mark@thefsupreme.dev) or DM @thefsupreme on discord.
